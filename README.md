In this assignment Starting from the Flaskr app starter code I am rebranding it and adding features to produce Flaskr Plus that will give user the abiility to provide category and then the ability to filter the post by category, so they can only see posts of the chosen category. The user should then also be able to delete individual posts with a button attached to each post.
